# Introduction

This code is based on the tutorial on Vue and webpack that is found here: https://skyronic.com/blog/vue-project-scratch that sets up a webpack solution for vue.

In extension it then looks at this tutorial: https://vue-loader.vuejs.org/en/workflow/testing-with-mocks.html to look at how mocks can be used in a vue project.
